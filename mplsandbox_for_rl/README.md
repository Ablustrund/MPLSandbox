# Providing feedback signals in RL

We validated the effectiveness of MPLSandbox in providing compiler feedback by integrating it into the RLCF framework, which significantly enhanced the code generation capabilities of LLMs. This code serves as a demonstration of using MPLSandbox's compiler feedback to provide reward signals for the PPO algorithm.
